       <span id="f-space">The first time I saw you, I had already fallen in love,</span><span class="hidden">but I was too shy to say it. I felt a little awkward because of our friend group. However, the moment when the two of us went to a concert—although we didn't really spend much time together and I made</span><span class="hidden">you wait for a minute because of a friend—was really memorable. That was the day that sparked my feelings for you again. It was also the day of our first real conversation in a long time, and that gave me the confidence to compliment you and tell you how I truly felt.</span>

        After I confessed my feelings to you and told you, "liligawan kita," I knew in my heart that I was willing to risk anything for us to be happy and together. Even though I'm shy and sometimes struggle to keep a long conversation going over chat, I still tried because, well, "ikaw na yan, e." Talking to you feels like playing an adventure game—its fun, exciting, and full of surprises. And honestly, Id spend as much time as it takes to figure out every little detail, just to know you better.</p>

      <p id="third" class="sen">
        Over time, I found myself genuinely enjoying our conversations, but I also started to feel drained. It wasn’t because of you; it was because I felt like I was always the one reaching out. If I didn’t start the conversation, it felt like we wouldn’t talk at all. I’m not upset with you—I’m more frustrated with myself. I wish I could entertain you as effortlessly as others do, or as I do with my own friends.
